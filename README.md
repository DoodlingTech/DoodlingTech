# 👋 Hi, I'm Boolie (@doodlingtech)

❤️‍🔥 I’m passionate about creating engaging and easy-to-follow tutorials for non-tech people, beginners, and intermediates on my YouTube channel, DoodlingTech. 

👀 I’m interested in web design, coding, and all things tech. My channel covers a wide range of topics, from WordPress tutorials to basic CSS and embedding AI into websites. I love sharing tips and tricks to help others improve their skills and create amazing web projects.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate AI with WordPress to make websites more dynamic and user-friendly.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting web design projects and coding challenges. Let's create something amazing together!
